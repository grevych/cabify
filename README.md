# Cabify Marketplace Challenge

Besides providing exceptional transportation services, Cabify also runs a physical store which sells 3 products:

``` 
Code         | Name                |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
VOUCHER      | Cabify Voucher      |   5.00€
TSHIRT       | Cabify T-Shirt      |  20.00€
MUG          | Cafify Coffee Mug   |   7.50€
```

Various departments have insisted on the following discounts:

 * The marketing department thinks a buy 2 get 1 free promotion will work best (buy two of the same product, get an additional one free), and would like this to only apply to `VOUCHER` items.

 * The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and requests that if you buy 3 or more `TSHIRT` items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.

This set of rules to apply may change quite frequently in the future.

Your task is to implement a checkout system for this store.

The system should have differentiated client and server components that communicate over the network.

The server should expose the following independent operations:

- Create a new checkout basket
- Add a product to a basket
- Get the total amount in a basket
- Remove the basket

The server must support concurrent invocations of those operations: any of them may be invoked at any time, while other operations are still being performed, even for the same basket.

The client must connect user input with those operations via the protocol exposed by the server.

We don't have any DBAs at Cabify, so the service shouldn't use any external databases of any kind.

Using Go, implement a checkout service and its client that fulfils these requirements.

Examples:

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, MUG
    Total: 32.50€

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, VOUCHER
    Total: 25.00€

    Items: TSHIRT, TSHIRT, TSHIRT, VOUCHER, TSHIRT
    Total: 81.00€

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, VOUCHER, VOUCHER, MUG, TSHIRT, TSHIRT
